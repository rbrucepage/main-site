While equipment problems have prevented us from making  detailed observations of Planet 10 itself, our efforts were  aided considerably by the discovery of an earth station  housed in the Stutz Business center at 10th and Capitol  streets in downtown Indianapolis.

REPORT: Field operative RS317 phoned in a sighting of what appeared to be two entities in  the sky on the North side of Indianapolis. Each entity appeared to be moving at  tremendous speed torward th other. Approximately  three minutes after the initial sighting, RS317 reported, that the  two entities collided. A bright flash of light illuminated the sky, and where there  had earlier been two entities, there now appeared to be one.  The new entitity appeared to be larger and brighter than either of it's  predecessors. Further observation over a period of weeks indicated the new entity  appeared to  be rapidly developing the characteristics of a planet. RS317 was ordered to  continue field studies. More information wil be forthcoming when it is avaialable. REPORT: Field operative RS317 phoned in a sighting of what appeared to be two entities in  the sky on the North side of Indianapolis.

More information wil be forthcoming when it is avaialable. REPORT: Field operative RS317 phoned in a sighting of what appeared to be two entities in  the sky on the North side of Indianapolis. Each entity appeared to be moving at  tremendous speed torward th other. Approximately  three minutes after the initial sighting, RS317 reported, that the  two entities collided. A bright flash of light illuminated the sky, and where there  had earlier been two entities, there now appeared to be one.  The new entitity appeared to be larger and brighter than either of it's  predecessors.

REPORT: Field operative RS317 has continued observations of Planet 10, and has reported that surface activities have increased substantially since the initial sighting  report. In fact, the amount of observable activity suggests life forms are drawing  on a rich base of resources and are creating a dynamic new entity in the galaxy. Such a high level of activity also leads to questions to which we currently have no  answers. For instance: •What, or who are these life forms? •Where did they come from? •What types of activities are they engaged in? Answers to these questions will continue to elude us until we can get a closer  look at Planet 10. We will be able to do that once we reposition our satellites,  reorient our radio telescopes, and reprogram our observatories, all of which are  currently being done. We expect to have everything ready in a matter of weeks.

Answers to these questions will continue to elude us until we can get a closer  look at Planet 10. We will be able to do that once we reposition our satellites,  reorient our radio telescopes, and reprogram our observatories, all of which are  currently being done. We expect to have everything ready in a matter of weeks.  REPORT: Field operative RS317 has continued observations of Planet 10, and has reported that surface activities have increased substantially since the initial sighting  report. In fact, the amount of observable activity suggests life forms are drawing  on a rich base of resources and are creating a dynamic new entity in the galaxy. Such a high level of activity also leads to questions to which we currently have no  answers. For instance: •What, or who are these life forms? •Where did they come from? •What types of activities are they engaged in?

Although their outer appearence mimics that  of a typical human, the creative nature of their species  differentiates them. We have, thus far, spotted five  variations of the Planet 10 life form. Each type has it's  own distinct features and habits, however they all seem  to integrate well together. Curiously, they all have the  capability of combining their strengths in a number of  different ways, further enhancing their creative nature.  More research must be done in order fully understand  the nature of the Planet 10 life forms. more information  will be forthcoming when it is available.

More research must be done in order fully understand  the nature of the Planet 10 life forms. more information  will be forthcoming when it is available.  REPORT: Evidence of various life forms have been found on  Planet 10. Although their outer appearence mimics that  of a typical human, the creative nature of their species  differentiates them. We have, thus far, spotted five  variations of the Planet 10 life form. Each type has it's  own distinct features and habits, however they all seem  to integrate well together. Curiously, they all have the  capability of combining their strengths in a number of  different ways, further enhancing their creative nature.  More research must be done in order fully understand  the nature of the Planet 10 life forms. more information  will be forthcoming when it is available.
